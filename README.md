# Public transport accessibility indicators in Great Britain

## General description

This contains the source-code used to develop a series of public transport accessibility indicators at the lower super output area/Datazone (LSOA/DZ) level covering the whole of Great Britain (GB) in the United Kingdom (UK). The indicators include a range of key amenities and services such as: employment; general practice (GP) surgery; hospital; grocery store; supermarket; primary school; secondary school; and urban centre. 

All the code used to create the indicators is available in this repository (<https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/access_uk_open>).

The map below shows accessibility to employment for two different time-thresholds as an illustrative example.

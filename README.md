# Public transport accessibility indicators in Great Britain

This contains the source-code used to develop a series of public transport accessibility indicators at the lower super output area/Datazone (LSOA/DZ) level covering the whole of Great Britain (GB) in the United Kingdom (UK). The indicators include a range of key amenities and services such as: employment; general practice (GP) surgery; hospital; grocery store; supermarket; primary school; secondary school; and urban centre. 

All the code used to create the indicators is available in this repository <https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/access_uk_open> (Please note that a former repository used for this purpose was archived and no longer maintained https://github.com/rafavdz/access_uk).

This project was developed at the [Urban Big Data Centre](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/) and it was funded by the [Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/).
